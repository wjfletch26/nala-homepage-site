# Nala Homepage 

The baddest, bestest dog in Texas

For this project, I (of course) wanted to showcase my "doghter", my dog Nala.  I modeled this webpage after the Starbucks landing page to better familiarize myself with HTML and CSS.  I wanted to customize it further and added Bootstrap into the mix (Image Carosels, animations, etc.)

## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS 
- Bootstrap 

## Design Choices
- Mobile-first - I designed this site to be mobile-first/responsive so when I meet someone and get to talking about my dog, I can tell them to check out her website on their phone (everyone loves dog photos, of course!)
- I kept the design simple and clean and utilized white-space and most importantly, photos.  
- I wanted this site to feel as if Nala had a say in the design, so I found a custom font in her handwriting and used it for the main header using Google's Font API.
