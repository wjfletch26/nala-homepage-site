# Nala Homepage 

The baddest, bestest dog in Texas

For this project, I (of course) wanted to showcase my "doghter", my dog Nala.  I modeled this webpage after the Starbucks landing page to better familiarize myself with HTML and CSS.  I wanted to customize it further and added Bootstrap into the mix (Image Carosels, animations, etc.)

## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS 
- Bootstrap
